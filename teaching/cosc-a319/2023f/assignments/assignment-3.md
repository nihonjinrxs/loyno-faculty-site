In this assignment, you'll create a web client using plain HTML and JavaScript (and some CSS for styling if you like).

This web client will pull data from a remote web API and display it in tabular format, allowing a user to filter and sort it in various ways.

## Your Assignment

To complete this assignment, you need to write the body of the `<script>`
tag in the `index.html` file to add appropriate listeners to relevant HTML
elements for specific events. In addition, you'll need to implement the
necessary JavaScript functions in `assets/scripts/index.js` to handle those
events and enable the relevant functionality.

As user stories, your requirements are:

- As a weather enthusiast, I would like to review record filings from weather
  stations, so that I can explore recent weather conditions.
- As a weather enthusiast, I would like to be able to review only reports
  from weather stations that were active, or not active, when the
  measurements were taken, so that I can assess whether there is a difference
  between the data from those sets of stations.
- As a weather enthusiast, I would like to be able to apply various sorts
  to the weather station reports, specifically by ID, date and time of
  last reading, temperature or humidity value, or active/inactive status,
  so that I can better understand the shape of the data.
- _Bonus challenge_: As a weather enthusiast, I would like to page through 
  data records in smaller quantities at a time so that I won't be overwhelmed
  by too many records at once.
- _Bonus challenge_: As a weather enthusiast, I would like to be able to
  filter the available data by weather station and by date range so that I
  can dive into the specifics of various locations and time periods.

For the purposes of this assignment, you will use fake weather station data
available from the API at: `https://dummy-data-api-server.fly.dev/`. This API has a root endpoint `https://dummy-data-api-server.fly.dev/` that indicates the health of the service, and an endpoint `https://dummy-data-api-server.fly.dev/data` that serves (fake) weather data records. Individual records have the following format:

```{json}
{
  "id": 1,
  "filing_id": "fd7da058-4ec3-4e85-b4cd-2c4365956511",
  "active": false,
  "description": "Sherbro International Airport",
  "last_reading": "2023-07-01T02:19:42Z",
  "measures": {
    "temperature": 65.65,
    "humidity": 58.73
  }
}
```

The `data` endpoint also accepts the following URL query parameters:

- `from` - the starting record ID to return records from (whole number value between `1` and `1000`, default)
- `count` - the number of records to return (whole number between `1` and `500`, default `100`.

So, for example, to load `231` records starting from record id `28`, you could use `https://dummy-data-api-server.fly.dev/data?from=28&count=231`.

The response body will have the overall format:

```{json}
{
  "count": <number of records>,
  "data": <array of records>
}
```

Specifically, based on the above user stories, your web page should:

- respond to clicks of the `Load data` button by loading the data from the remote server
- populate the data, once loaded, into an HTML table, respecting the relevant filtering and sorting settings selected by the user
- repopulate the table with appropriately sorted data rows when a the sorting setting is changed by the user
- repopulate the table with appropriately filtered data rows when the filtering setting is changed by the user

(Note that you do not necessarily need to make a new request to the API for data unless you don't already have the data the user needs in memory, or the user clicks the `Load data` button again. Because of this, it's a good idea to separate the data loading functionality of your JavaScript code from the table rendering functionality.)

### Expected Output

For this assignment, loading your web page (served by a web server) should enable the above-mentioned requirements. A minimal example of this, not implementing the bonus challenges, might look like:

Note that you are free to use the `assets/styles/main.css` file to style your webpage in any way you prefer. Please be creative and add some personal style to your assignment!

### Program Structure

The project structure is a simple website structure using HTML for content
structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. No front-end
frameworks or libraries are used (or should be used) on this assignment.

In this repo, you will find several files:

- `index.html` - this is the starting point for your project, and what will
  load your JavaScript code and CSS styling rules.
- `assets` - a holding place for assets to be loaded by the HTML file(s).
  - `assets/styles` - a location where you can place any CSS files you create.
    - `assets/styles/main.css` - the starting point for your CSS styling.
  - `assets/scripts` - a location where you can place any JavaScript files you create.
    - `assets/styles/main.js` - the location where you should put any functions
      directly referenced by the `index.html` file. (There is a comment at the top of
      this file with information that may be helpful.)

There are comments througout the `index.html` file indicating locations where specific work should happen within the file. Please read and pay attention to these, as they will help you complete the assignment.

#### Getting started on the assignment

As with prior assignments, in order to get started with the assignment, you'll want to do the following things:

- Review this assignment description in detail
- Clone this repo to your computer and explore the contents
- Read through the comments and code included for you, particularly in `index.js` and `assets/scripts/main.js`
- Take the requirements one-by-one, implementing them and verifying that they work as expected.

Unlike prior assignments, there are no automated tests for this assignment. (There could be, but creating them is fairly involved, and it's easer for this simple assignment to verify by running your code directly.)

### Submission and Feedback

You must submit your changes as commits to a new branch on the repository. You will need to create a pull request on the repository which compares that branch against the base branch `main`. As you push your commits on your branch up to Github, they will be added to the activity on this pull request.

In addition to the synchronous mechanism of requesting help via office hours appointments, your pull request will be your mechanism for asking questions and requesting help asynchronously during the course of this assignment. I will also use this pull request to provide feedback on your work. I will provide feedback on the completed assignment within a week of the due date of the assignment. If you push your code earlier than the due date, I will try to provide feedback as needed earlier.

I suggest that you push your work to Github as you make commits, and that you make commits frequently as you work on the assignment. This way, if you have questions, I will be able to review your work-in-progress and give more relevant answers and feedback. If you have a question specific to a particular area of the code, note that you can add comments inline on the pull request by clicking on the **Files changed** tab of the pull request, then clicking the little blue `+` icon that appears when you hover
over a specific line of code.

I will do my best to respond to questions posed during the course of the assignment with in a day of the ask. **If you want to ask a question or request early feedback, please tag me in a comment on the pull request: `@nihonjinrxs`.**

Good luck, and I look forward to seeing what you create!
