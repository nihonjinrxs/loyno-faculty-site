  project:
    title: Project
    icon: üèó
    description: |
      During this course, you will be building a multi-component internet system using some of the concepts learned through lecture and demo.

      ### Project Components

      The project entails creating several components:

      * a **web API server** that can provide data and back-end services for client applications
      * a **browser-based client application** (commonly called a "web app") for interacting with the server's back-end services via a computer through a website
      * a **mobile application** (such as you might find in an app store like Apple's or Google Play) for interacting with the server's back-end services via a mobile phone
      * a **web-of-things client hardware device** for displaying (and possibly minimally interacting with) the server's back-end services, using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ system board

      ### What to Expect

      Several class periods during the semester are set aside for working on the project during class. These days will help you to get started building out the required functionality, but likely will not be enough to complete the project. **Please expect to dedicate time outside of class to working on the project on your own.**

      ### Tools and Equipment
      
      #### JavaScript
      
      All programming for the project will be done using JavaScript. The required "textbook" *Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Ed.* (see [Textbooks](#textbooks) above) is a great interactive online resource that allows you to play with the code examples from within the browser to get a feel for how the code works. It teaches modern JavaScript coding style and syntax, which is what we'll use during the majority of this course.

      JavaScript was originally meant for the web browser. However, it is now used often in various non-browser ways. For this project, we'll use the following JavaScript based tools:

      * API:
        * [Node.js ("LTS" v10.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
        * [nvm (on macOS or Linux)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-windows (on Windows)](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
        * [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) and/or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
      * Web App:
        * [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
        * [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/)
      * Mobile App: [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
      * Web of Things Client: [onoff](https://www.npmjs.com/package/onoff)

      #### Web of Things Client Equipment
      
      Equipment for the web of things client will be provided by the instructor. A few cautions about university-provided equipment:
      
      * If you break the equipment, you'll need to pay for it. Please take care of it.
      * If you fail to return the equipment, you'll need to pay for it. Please return it during the final exam period.
      * If you wish to build something during the course that you can keep and use, please consult with the instructor to find out what you need to purchase.

      #### Hardware Design Tools
      
      A helpful tool for hardware design is the free [Fritzing App](https://fritzing.org/home/), which provides a virtual design lab with ready-made hardware components. You may wish to install and use this to create your hardware design prior to implementing it.

      ### Project Poster for Extra Credit

      If you personalize and complete your multi-component project, you also have an opportunity for 500 points of extra credit if you create a poster (using the provided template) explaining the system, its design and operation, and the process used to build and test it.
      
      Please contact the instructor if you wish to create a poster.
  reflection:
    title: Reflection Journals
    icon: üìì
    description: |
      ### Weekly Journal Entries
      
      During this course, you will also be keeping **a journal with at least weekly reflections on your experiences**, including but not limited to the following topics:
      
      * content covered in lectures or textbooks
      * your project build or the tools used to build it
      * your learning process
      * your time management / procrastination practices
      * your questions for further learning after the class
      * connections to other courses or course material you've made
      * "Ah ha!" moments you've had during this course
      * how the experiences and material in this course relate to your degree program
      * how the experiences and material in this course might be relevant to your future career

      **Journal entries will be due at the end of the day every Friday** (i.e., just before midnight Central time), with the exception of the first entry, which you'll do during the first class period.

      ### Reflection Essay

      At the end of the semester, you will be required to write **a short (5-10 pages) personal reflection essay** examining the following questions:

      * What activities did you perform during this course?
      * What were your expectations at the beginning of the course? How did your expectations and attitudes change throughout the semester?
      * Describe a moment of clarity that occurred for you during this course? What made the concept clear for you? How did you gain a better understanding of it?
      * Did the project in this course make your understanding of software development and computer science clearer? Your understanding of the Internet and Internet-based applications? How?
      * What did you learn about yourself during this experience?
      * What did you learn about others during this experience?
      * How can you use what you learned through this experience in your future coursework and in your future career? Do you feel better prepared for your career path after this experience? Why?
      * What topics will you continue exploring after the course? Why does each interest you? How will you go about exploring each of those concepts?

      This paper is **due on Thursday, December 5, 2019, at 4:55 PM** just before our last regular class period.

      ### How you will be graded

      **Content.** Your paper must address all the above questions. Reflection essays may explore other topics related to these questions, but if these questions are not addressed, you will lose points. Journal entries must address at least one of the questions, and should not address the same question each week.

      **Depth of Personal Reflection.** Your paper and journal entries must show depth of reflection. Learning often means struggling not only with new concepts and ideas, but also with your own habits and perceptions. Spend enough time thinking about this and reflecting on these questions that you are able to feel that struggle.
      
      **Correctness.** In addition to content, you will be graded on the correctness of your writing (spelling, grammar, punctuation, word choice, etc.), and on the readability and formatting of your submitted paper (font choice, margins, line length, spacing, etc.). Please be careful in your writing and be sure to proofread before submitting.
