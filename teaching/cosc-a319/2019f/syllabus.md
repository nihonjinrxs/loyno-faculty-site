  project:
    title: Project
    icon: üèó
    description: |
      During this course, you will be building a multi-component internet system using some of the concepts learned through lecture and demo.

      ### Project Components

      The project entails creating several components:

      * a **web API server** that can provide data and back-end services for client applications
      * a **web-of-things hardware device** for reporting the state of a number of sensors and interacting with the API server's back-end services, using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ system board
      * a **browser-based client application** (commonly called a "web app") for interacting with the API server's back-end services via a computer through a website
      * a **mobile application** (such as you might find in an app store like Apple's or Google Play) for interacting with the server's back-end services via a mobile phone

      ### What to Expect

      Several class periods during the semester are set aside for working on the project during class. These days will help you to get started building out the required functionality for each assignment with instructor/faculty assistance, but likely will not be enough to complete the project assignments. **Please expect to dedicate time outside of class to working on the project on your own.**

      ### Tools and Equipment
      
      #### JavaScript
      
      All programming for the project will be done using JavaScript. The required "textbook" *Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Ed.* (see [Textbooks](#textbooks) above) is a great interactive online resource that allows you to play with the code examples from within the browser to get a feel for how the code works. It teaches modern JavaScript coding style and syntax, which is what we'll use during the majority of this course.

      JavaScript was originally meant for the web browser. However, it is now used often in various non-browser ways. For this project, we'll use the following JavaScript based tools:

      * Web App:
        * [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
        * [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/)
      * API:
        * [nvm (on macOS or Linux)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-windows (on Windows)](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
        * [Node.js ("LTS" v10.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
        * [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) and/or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
      * Web of Things Device:
        * [onoff](https://www.npmjs.com/package/onoff)
        * [Electron.js](https://electronjs.org/)
        * Node.js (with nvm & npm/yarn), React.js and Create React App
      * Mobile App: [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

      #### Web of Things Device Equipment
      
      Equipment for the web of things device will be provided by the instructor. A few cautions about university-provided equipment:
      
      * If you break the equipment, you'll need to pay for it. Please take care of it.
      * If you fail to return the equipment, you'll need to pay for it. Please return it during the final exam period.
      * If you wish to build something during the course that you can keep and use, please consult with the instructor to find out what you need to purchase.

      #### Hardware Design Tools
      
      A helpful tool for hardware design is the free [Fritzing App](https://fritzing.org/home/), which provides a virtual design lab with ready-made hardware components.
      
      For the project assignments, your instructor will provide plans in fritzing format for you to use, should you wish, in addition to images of those plans for you to follow.

      If you personalize your project, you may wish to install and use this software to create your hardware design prior to implementing it.

      #### Network Inspection Tools

      During this course, we will be learning to use a variety of basic Linux command line tools (that are available on almost every installation of Linux) to inspect the networks of the Internet and how our computers interact with them.

      In some cases, these are not enough, and we want to inspect the packet-level data being transmitted through the network. In such cases, there are a few useful tools you can use.

      Although not strictly related to the project, you may find some of these tools useful in debugging what you build.

      * [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) - the most commonly used network protocol analyzer, providing facilities for live capture and offline analysis of network traffic data at the packet and byte level. Also provides `tshark`, the command-line version of Wireshark. This was originally named "Ethereal", with command-line version `tethereal`.
      * Under the hood of Wireshark is `libpcap`, which is part of the [`tcpdump` command line packet analyzer](https://www.tcpdump.org/). Somewhat harder to use, it provides raw capture capability for cases where Wireshark is not enough. (Your instructor has not found any cases like this yet.)
      * [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) is a web debugging proxy that is sometimes useful for manipulating a web session or intentionally impacting network performance when building internet-based software.
      * [Zenmap](https://nmap.org/zenmap/), the graphical interface for the `nmap` command line tool, provides facilities for scanning networks and systems for security vulnerabilities.

      During this course, we will use Wireshark during demos to explore the protocol layers of internet message packets when we dive into the details of the various protocols.

      ### Extra Credit Opportunities

      There are a few extra credit opportunities associated with the project that you may wish to take advantage of.

      #### Personalize Your Project (up to 500 points)

      You may choose to personalize your project in some way for extra credit. Some ideas for how you might do so are:

      * add an integration with the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) that pulls in weather forecasts for one or more locations (configurable, of course) periodically and makes them available with the sensor data through all interfaces
      * create an online brand for your weather station, and redesign each interface to match the brand you create, so everything looks like a coherent product
      * add a camera, and implement user recognition and preferences setting using face detection
      * add additional sensors to report information you're interested in seeing, and add them to your interfaces
      * upgrade your API to accept streaming data connections (perhaps via [web sockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)), and provide near-real-time temperature and humidity data feeds to all connected clients
      * enhance the mobile app client to support both iOS and Android phone platforms, aligning your design with each of their user interface guidelines and commonly accepted user interface patterns

      Be creative and make your project yours.  You'll have fun, and you'll be rewarded with up to 500 extra points too!
      
      <small>(The total amount of points awarded will depend on the difficulty and complexity of the enhancements, and will be at the discretion of the instructor.)</small>

      #### Project Poster (500 points)
      
      ##### Option A

      If you complete your multi-component project **and personalize it**, you also have an opportunity for 500 more points of extra credit if you create a poster (using the instructor-provided template) explaining the system, its design and operation, and the process used to build and test it.

      ##### Option B

      Use your project to explore in detail some of the protocols and transport mechanisms covered in this course. Use some of the network inspection tools listed above to explore the data transport between components of your app, and create a poster explaining in detail what you are seeing and how that works in relation to the protocols used.
      
      Please contact the instructor if you wish to create a poster.
  reflection:
    title: Reflection Journals
    icon: üìì
    description: |
      ### Weekly Journal Entries
      
      During this course, you will also be keeping **a journal with at least weekly reflections on your experiences**, including but not limited to the following topics:
      
      * content covered in lectures or textbooks
      * your project build or the tools used to build it
      * your learning process
      * your time management / procrastination practices
      * your questions for further learning after the class
      * connections to other courses or course material you've made
      * "Aha!" moments you've had during this course
      * how the experiences and material in this course relate to your degree program
      * how the experiences and material in this course might be relevant to your future career

      **Journal entries will be due at the end of the day every Friday** (i.e., just before midnight Central time), with the exception of the first entry, which you'll do during the first class period. Journal entries must be submitted using the Reflections Journals in Blackboard. Be sure to write your entry into the journal with the appropriate due date.
      
      Additional journal entries beyond those required weekly may be eligible for extra credit points at the instructor's discretion.

      ### Reflection Essay

      At the end of the semester, you will be required to write **a short (5-10 pages) personal reflection essay** examining the following questions:

      * What activities did you perform during this course?
      * What were your expectations at the beginning of the course? How did your expectations and attitudes change throughout the semester?
      * Describe a moment of clarity that occurred for you during this course? What made the concept clear for you? How did you gain a better understanding of it?
      * Did the project in this course make your understanding of software development and computer science clearer? Your understanding of the Internet and Internet-based applications? How?
      * What did you learn about yourself during this experience?
      * What did you learn about others during this experience?
      * How can you use what you learned through this experience in your future coursework and in your future career? Do you feel better prepared for your career path after this experience? Why?
      * What topics will you continue exploring after the course? Why does each interest you? How will you go about exploring each of those concepts?

      This paper is **due on Thursday, December 5, 2019, at 4:55 PM** just before our last regular class period, and **must be submitted in PDF format through the Blackboard assignment**, which uses SafeAssign. Unless you have arranged with me ahead of time due to some unforeseen circumstance, essays emailed to me or handed in on paper will not be graded and will receive zero credit.

      ### How you will be graded

      **Content.** Your paper must address all the above questions. Reflection essays may explore other topics related to these questions, but if these questions are not addressed, you will lose points. Journal entries must address at least one of the questions, and should not address the same question each week.

      **Depth of Personal Reflection.** Your paper and journal entries must show depth of reflection. Learning often means struggling not only with new concepts and ideas, but also with your own habits and perceptions. Spend enough time thinking about this and reflecting on these questions that you are able to feel that struggle.
      
      **Correctness.** In addition to content, you will be graded on the correctness of your writing (spelling, grammar, punctuation, word choice, etc.), and on the readability and formatting of your submitted paper (font choice, margins, line length, spacing, etc.). Please be careful in your writing and be sure to proofread before submitting.
