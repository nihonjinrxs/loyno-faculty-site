## üèó PROJECT DAY 1 - Web Client

For PROJECT DAY 1, you'll build the web application that will eventually display data from the sensors on the device (which you haven't built yet) and allow you to view it from whereever you may have an Internet connection and a web browser.

### üõ† The Tools

To do this, we'll use JavaScript with HTML and CSS, as you might expect, but we'll also use two key JavaScript libraries and four infrastructure tools/services:

#### üì¶ JavaScript Libraries

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - a library for building dynamic web interfaces using JavaScript in a componentized and manageable way. Along with React, [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) is a companion library that scaffolds a web-based application for you using React for components. (This scaffolding piece will be done for you for this first project day.)
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - a testing library included with the project scaffold created by create-react-app that allows testing your code. Along with Jest, [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) is a companion library that provides easy ways to render components and assert properties on them when testing.

#### üè≠ Infrastructure Services

* [Github](https://github.com) - a web service providing hosting and additional features for the [git](https://git-scm.com/) distributed version control system. You'll be using git and Github to manage your codebase.
* [Travis CI](https://education.travis-ci.com) - a continuous integration platform that you'll use to ensure every commit you push to Github passes all automated tests.
* [Docker (Community Edition)](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community) - a software containerization platform that allows building an image of your software and deploying that built image.
* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) - a suite of cloud services where we will deploy our work. (You should already have applied for, and hopefully received, [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/) membership, which provides some free credits in addition to the free services you get during the first year of AWS membership.)

### ‚úÖ Requirements for the Assignment

Create a web-based application that provides an interface to the data collected by your IoT/WoT Device Weather Station, displaying temperature and humidity data using the user's choice of scale for temperature display.

Assume that data reported by the Weather Station is in Celsius degrees for temperature and in percentage for humidity.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements

1. Build an application that is viewable through a web browser.
2. The application should have a single page that shows a title and well-formatted temperature and humidity values.
3. The page should be decorated with an image background.
4. The application should simulate real data for display by generating random numbers in a realistic range (about 7¬∞C &ndash; 33¬∞C for temperature and about 5% &ndash; 98% for humidity).
5. The application should display real-time updates of the data on the page without refreshing the page in the browser.
6. The application should allow the user to select the temperature display units, and should display the data in the requested units without refreshing the page in the browser.

#### üî© Source Code, Process & Deployment Requirements

1. Code for the application should be well-organized, using components and folders to keep related code together.
2. The application should make use of Github for version control. Commits should be small, be well-described in their commit messages, and contain a single change to the application.
3. All code for the application should be well-tested. (This means that for each function you write, you should write at least one, and possibly several, tests.) Automated tests should run on every commit and pull request to the repo.
4. The application should be deployed to Amazon Web Services as a Docker Container, and should be live (that is, publicly available on the Internet).

## üèó PROJECT DAY 2 - Server API

For PROJECT DAY 2, you'll build the server API that will collect and serve data collected from your sensors.

### üíØ Points Possible: **500**

### üõ† The Tools

To do this, we'll use JavaScript in its Node.js form, but we'll also use a few key JavaScript libraries and four infrastructure tools/services:

#### üì¶ JavaScript Libraries

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - a library for building web servers.
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - a testing library (chosen because this is hat was used for Project Day 1, included with the project scaffold created by create-react-app) that allows testing your code. Along with Jest, [jest-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-express) is a companion library that provides easy ways to interact with the core objects in the Express library.

#### üè≠ Infrastructure Services

* [Github](https://github.com) - a web service providing hosting and additional features for the [git](https://git-scm.com/) distributed version control system. You'll be using git and Github to manage your codebase.
* [Travis CI](https://education.travis-ci.com) - a continuous integration platform that you'll use to ensure every commit you push to Github passes all automated tests.
* [Docker (Community Edition)](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community) - a software containerization platform that allows building an image of your software and deploying that built image.
* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) - a suite of cloud services where we will deploy our work. (You should already have applied for, and hopefully received, [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/) membership, which provides some free credits in addition to the free services you get during the first year of AWS membership.)

### ‚úÖ Requirements for the Assignment

In this portion of the project, you'll build an API with endpoints that allow getting weather sensor data, updating weather sensor data, and eventually registering sensors with the API to handle multiple sensors.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements

1. Create a new Express-based API with a single `GET` endpoint at the path `/beacon` that responds with a `200` status code, and the plain text `OK`. Appropriate response headers should be set when the API returns a response.
2. Create a new `GET` endpoint at `/weather-sensor/data` to get data from the sensor. The endpoint should respond with JSON-format data with keys `"temperature"` and `"humidity"`. Appropriate response headers should be set when the API returns a response. Values for temperature and humidity can be generated randomly upon request for now.
3. Create a new `POST` endpoint at `/weather-sensor/update` to allow a sensor to send new data to the API. Successful operation should result in a `201` status code. Appropriate response headers should be set when the API returns a response.
4. Update the API to maintain a list of registered sensors in memory, and modify the previously created `GET` and `POST` requests to accept a path-based parameter `:id` for the sensor identifier, moving their mount points to `/weather-sensors/:id/{data|update}`.
5. Create a new `GET` endpoint at `/weather-sensors` that returns a list of sensors registered with the API. Appropriate response status code and headers should be set when the API returns a response.
6. Create a new `POST` endpoint at `/weather-sensors/register` that allows a weather sensor device to register itself with the API. Appropriate response status code and headers should be set when the API returns a response.

#### üî© Source Code, Process & Deployment Requirements

1. Code for the application should be well-organized, using components and folders to keep related code together.
2. The application should make use of Github for version control. Commits should be small, be well-described in their commit messages, and contain a single change to the application.
3. All code for the application should be well-tested. (This means that for each function you write, you should write at least one, and possibly several, tests.) Automated tests should run on every commit and pull request to the repo.
4. The application should be deployed to Amazon Web Services as a Docker Container, and should be live (that is, publicly available on the Internet).
