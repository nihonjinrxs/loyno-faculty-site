  project:
    title: Project
    icon: üèó
    description: |
      During this course, you will build a multi-component internet system using some of the concepts learned through lecture and demo.

      ### Project Components

      The project entails creating two key components:

      * a **web API server** that can provide data and back-end services for client applications
      * a **browser-based client application** (commonly called a "web app") for interacting with the API server's back-end services via a computer through a website

      ### What to Expect

      Several class periods during the semester are set aside for demonstrations, homework help, or lab exploration. These days are opportunities for you to see how such projects are built, ask questions about issues you are having on your own project, or tell your peers about problems you've experienced while working on your project and how you overcame them. These sessions will be enough time to clarify the required functionality for each assignment with instructor/faculty assistance, get started on project work or assignments, and get help on problems you are experiencing while working on projects or assignments. However, these sessions likely will not be enough to complete the project. **Please expect to dedicate time outside of class to working on the project on your own.**

      ### Tools and Equipment
      
      #### JavaScript
      
      All programming for the project will be done using JavaScript. The required "textbook" *Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Ed.* (see [Textbooks](#textbooks) above) is a great interactive online resource that allows you to play with the code examples from within the browser to get a feel for how the code works. It teaches modern JavaScript coding style and syntax, which is what we'll use during the majority of this course.

      JavaScript was originally meant for the web browser. However, it is now used often in various non-browser ways. For this project, we'll use the following JavaScript based tools:

      * Web App:
        * [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
        * [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/)
      * API:
        * [nvm (on macOS or Linux)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-windows (on Windows)](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
        * [Node.js ("LTS" v12.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
        * [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) and/or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
        * [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

      #### Network Inspection Tools

      During this course, we will be learning to use a variety of basic Linux command line tools (that are available on almost every installation of Linux) to inspect the networks of the Internet and how our computers interact with them.

      In some cases, these are not enough, and we want to inspect the packet-level data being transmitted through the network. In such cases, there are a few useful tools you can use.

      Although not strictly related to the project, you may find some of these tools useful in debugging what you build.

      * [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) - the most commonly used network protocol analyzer, providing facilities for live capture and offline analysis of network traffic data at the packet and byte level. Also provides `tshark`, the command-line version of Wireshark. This was originally named "Ethereal", with command-line version `tethereal`.
      * Under the hood of Wireshark is `libpcap`, which is part of the [`tcpdump` command line packet analyzer](https://www.tcpdump.org/). Somewhat harder to use, it provides raw capture capability for cases where Wireshark is not enough. (Your instructor has not found any cases like this yet.)
      * [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) is a web debugging proxy that is sometimes useful for manipulating a web session or intentionally impacting network performance when building internet-based software.
      * [Zenmap](https://nmap.org/zenmap/), the graphical interface for the `nmap` command line tool, provides facilities for scanning networks and systems for security vulnerabilities.

      During this course, we will use Wireshark during demos to explore the protocol layers of internet message packets when we dive into the details of the various protocols.

      ### Personalize Your Project

      Be creative and make your project yours.  You'll have fun, and you'll create something you can be proud to show off to your classmate and even to potential employers!

      ### Celebration!

      We'll use the final exam period to host a celebration of our project work. You'll have the chance to show off what you did and talk about why it's important to you, and we'll cheer each other on as we do.
  reflection:
    title: Reflection Journals
    icon: üìì
    description: |
      ### Weekly Journal Entries
      
      During this course, you will also be keeping **a journal with at least weekly reflections on your experiences**, including but not limited to the following topics:
      
      * content covered in lectures or textbooks
      * your project build or the tools used to build it
      * your learning process
      * your time management / procrastination practices
      * your questions for further learning after the class
      * connections to other courses or course material you've made
      * "Aha!" moments you've had during this course
      * how the experiences and material in this course relate to your degree program
      * how the experiences and material in this course might be relevant to your future career

      **Journal entries will be due at the end of the day every Monday** (i.e., just before midnight Central time), with the exception of the first entry, which you'll do during the first class period. Journal entries must be submitted using the **REFLECT** assignments in Canvas. Be sure to write your entry into the Reflection assignment with the appropriate due date.
      
      Additional journal entries beyond those required weekly may be helpful as you capture your thoughts and information about your learning that may be useful in determining what grade you believe you earned. You can add those by resubmitting any already submitted Reflection assignment with additional content. Be sure to date the new entry at the beginning so it's obvious that it's a new entry.

    description: |
      ### Reflection Essays

      At the midpoint and at the end of the semester, you will be required to write **short (5-10 pages) personal reflection essays** based on your reflection journaling examining the following questions:

      * What grade do you believe you've earned in this course so far? Why?
      * What activities did you perform during this course?
      * What were your expectations at the beginning of the course? How did your expectations and attitudes change throughout the semester?
      * Describe moments of clarity that occurred for you during this course? What made the concept clear for you? How did you gain a better understanding of it?
      * Did the project in this course make your understanding of software development and computer science clearer? Your understanding of the Internet and Internet-based applications? How?
      * What did you learn about yourself during this experience?
      * What did you learn about others during this experience?
      * How can you use what you learned through this experience in your future coursework and in your future career? Do you feel better prepared for your career path after this experience? Why?
      * What topics will you continue exploring after the course? Why does each interest you? How will you go about exploring each of those concepts?

      ### Due Dates
      
      These papers are due:
      
      * MIDTERM GRADE PROPOSAL REFLECTION PAPER **due on Monday, October 12, 2020, by 11:59 PM US Central**
      * FINAL GRADE PROPOSAL REFLECTION PAPER **due on Friday, December 18, 2020, by 11:59 PM US Central**
  
      ### Submission Information
      
      Papers **must be submitted in PDF format through the Canvas assignment**, which uses Urkund for plaigiarism detection. Unless you have arranged with me ahead of time due to some unforeseen circumstance, essays emailed to me or transmitted by some other mechanism result in you forfeiting your ability to weigh in on your grade for that portion of the course, meaning that my decision, based on what I know of your work so far, will be final.

      ### How you will be graded

      Each of your grade proposals, so long as they are well-defended with specific personal reflections, will be the primary consideration for your grade at the midterm and for your final grade in the course respectively.

      In order to ensure your grade proposal is well-defended, you will want to focus on the following:

      **Content.** In order to effectively argue for a passing grade, your paper _must_ address all the above questions. Reflection essays may explore other topics related to these questions if they are relevant to demonstrating your learning or defending your grade proposal, but if the listed questions are not addressed, this will significantly weaken your argument. In preparation for this, you may wish to address at least one of those questions in each journal entry, and not address the same question each week.

      **Depth of Personal Reflection.** Your paper and journal entries should show depth of reflection. Learning often means struggling not only with new concepts and ideas, but also with your own habits and perceptions. Spend enough time thinking about this and reflecting on these questions that you are able to feel that struggle. Your argument for your grade will be much more convincing if you have put in this work and are able to discuss it.
      
      **Correctness.** In addition to content, the correctness of your writing (spelling, grammar, punctuation, word choice, etc.), and the readability and formatting of your submitted paper (font choice, margins, line length, spacing, etc.), are important factors in making a convincing written defense. Papers that are difficult to read result in fragmented understanding of your argument and disrupt the ideas you are trying to communicate. Please be careful in your writing and be sure to proofread before submitting.
  grades:
    ungrading: |
      **Grading in this course is non-traditional.** While you will be receiving direct feedback on the assignment and project work you do, your reflection journal entries, and your participation in class, you will not be receiving numeric or letter grades for each individual assignment or class period. Instead, I will set your mid-term and final letter grades based on the outcome of the following two-step process.
      
      **Step 1. You propose your grade in Reflection Essays.** You will have two opportunities, one at mid-term and one at the end of the course, to propose what letter grade you feel you've earned in the course and to defend it based on your effort, learning, accomplishments, and reflections. These proposals will be submitted in the form of reflection papers, as detailed above in **[Assessments](#final)**.

      **Step 2. I assess your proposal and either accept or adjust.** When I receive your proposal, I will use your proposed grade if:
        
        1. you have provided sufficient evidence of learning 
        2. I have no concerns about the grade you have proposed
      
      However, I will adjust your proposed grade up or down as needed if I believe that any of the following are true:
        
        1. you have not earned the grade you proposed (adjust downward)
        2. you have not provided sufficient evidence of learning meriting the grade you proposed (adjust downward)
        3. you have actually earned a grade better than that which you proposed (adjust upward)
        4. there are special circumstances which you have not accounted for that impact the grade you should receive (either upward or downward as appropriate)

      In the case where an adjustment is needed, I will discuss that with you in a one-on-one conversation scheduled as soon as possible outside of classtime (usually within office hours).

      **Early Feedback Opportunity.** If you are concerned about whether you have earned a specific grade or how to defend a grade proposal, you are welcome to talk with me about what you plan to propose while working on  your reflection paper, and I can help guide you on what might be compelling in defense of that grade. **This must be done early in the assignment period and not at the last minute.** If you wait until the last minute, I may not be able to accomodate a meeting prior to having to submit grades.
