In this assignment, you'll create a web client using plain HTML and JavaScript (and some CSS for styling if you like).

This web client will pull data from a remote web API and display it in tabular format, allowing a user to filter
and sort it in various ways.

## Your Assignment

To complete this assignment, you need to write the body of the `<script>`
tag in the `index.html` file to add appropriate listeners to relevant HTML
elements for specific events. In addition, you'll need to implement the
necessary JavaScript functions in `assets/scripts/index.js` to handle those
events and enable the relevant functionality.

As user stories, your requirements are:

- As a weather enthusiast, I would like to review record filings from weather
  stations, so that I can explore recent weather conditions.
- As a weather enthusiast, I would like to be able to review only reports
  from currently active, or currently inactive, weather stations, so that I can
  assess whether there is a difference between the data from those sets of stations.
- As a weather enthusiast, I would like to be able to apply various sorts to the
  weather station reports, specifically by ID, date and time of last reading,
  temperature or humidity value, or active/inactive status, so that I can better
  understand the shape of the data.

For the purposes of this assignment, you will use fake weather station data
available from this API endpoint: `http://dummy-data-api-server.herokuapp.com/data`.

Specifically, based on the above user stories, your web page should:

- respond to clicks of the `Load data` button by loading the data from the remote server
- populate the data, once loaded, into an HTML table, respecting the relevant filtering
  and sorting settings selected by the user
- repopulate the table with appropriately sorted data rows when a the sorting setting is
  changed by the user
- repopulate the table with appropriately filtered data rows when the filtering setting
  is changed by the user

(Note that you do not need to make a new request to the API for data unless the user clicks
the `Load data` button again. Because of this, it's a good idea to separate the data loading
functionality of your JavaScript code from the table rendering functionality.)

### Expected Output

For this assignment, loading your web page (served by a web server) should enable the
above-mentioned requirements. An example of this might look like:

### Program Structure

The project structure is a simple website structure using HTML for content
structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. No front-end
frameworks or libraries are used (or should be used) on this assignment.

In this repo, you will find several files:

- `index.html` - this is the starting point for your project, and what will
  load your JavaScript code and CSS styling rules.
- `assets` - a holding place for assets to be loaded by the HTML file(s).
  - `assets/styles` - a location where you can place any CSS files you create.
    - `assets/styles/main.css` - the starting point for your CSS styling.
  - `assets/scripts` - a location where you can place any JavaScript files you create.
    - `assets/styles/main.js` - the location where you should put any functions
      directly referenced by the `index.html` file. (There is a comment at the top of
      this file with information that may be helpful.)

There are comments througout the `index.html` file indicating locations where specific
work should happen within the file. Please read and pay attention to these, as they
will help you complete the assignment.

> You may note that the `master` branch has been changed to the `main` branch.
> This is in response to current events, recognizing the lingering master/slave
> connotation of the existing `master` branch naming, and desiring to make
> branch naming more inclusive. These changes are being made to both `git` and to
> Github. For more on these changes, see [this pull request to `git`](https://github.com/gitgitgadget/git/pull/655)
> and [Github's README on their work](https://github.com/github/renaming). [Gitlab
> is also making similar changes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221164), as are others.

#### Getting started on the assignment

As with prior assignments, in order to get started with the assignment, you'll want
to do the following things:

- Review this assignment description in detail
- Clone this repo to your computer and explore the contents
- Read through the comments and code included for you, particularly in `index.js` and `assets/scripts/main.js`
- Take the requirements one-by-one, implementing them and verifying that they work as expected.

Unlike prior assignments, there are no automated tests for this assignment. (There could be, but creating them
is fairly involved, and it's easer for this simple assignment to verify by running your code directly.)

### Submission and Feedback

You must submit your changes as commits to the `main` branch on the repository.
Github Classroom will create a pull request on the repository for you, titled
**Feedback**. As you push your commits on the `main` branch up to Github, they
will be added to the activity on this pull request.

In addition to the synchronous mechanism of requesting help via office hours
appointments, this pull request will be your mechanism for asking questions and
requesting help asynchronously during the course of this assignment. I will also
use this pull request to provide feedback on your work. I will provide feedback on
the completed assignment within a week of the due date of the assignment.
If you push your code earlier than the due date, I will try to provide
feedback as needed earlier.

I suggest that you push your work to Github as you make commits, and that you make
commits frequently as you work on the assignment. This way, if you have questions,
I will be able to review your work-in-progress and give more relevant answers and
feedback. If you have a question specific to a particular area of the code, note that
you can add comments inline on the pull request by clicking on the **Files changed** tab
of the pull request, then clicking the little blue `+` icon that appears when you hover
over a specific line of code.

I will do my best to respond to questions posed during the course of the assignment with
in a day of the ask. **If you want to ask a question or request early feedback, please tag
me in a comment on the pull request: `@nihonjinrxs`.**

Good luck, and I look forward to seeing what you create!
