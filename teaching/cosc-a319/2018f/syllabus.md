      This course explores the concepts and technologies that are used in modern Internet systems, and provides the necessary skills and knowledge of software technologies needed for creating Internet/Web services. It is designed to expose students to web content presentation and generation technologies, programming, and building multi-tiered client/server web applications.
    description: |
      This course introduces students to the world of internet and networked systems development. Concepts related to distributed systems development; concurrent and asynchronous processing; process communications and network transport protocols; distributed application architecture and design; deployment, monitoring and debugging of internet-based systems; and web of things development will be covered.
    prerequisites: |
      One of:

      * [COSC A212 Introduction to Programming II](http://2017bulletin.loyno.edu/undergraduate/computer-science#cosc-a212) and Sophomore standing
      * Instructor Approval.

      To be successful in this course, students are expected to have practical experience building software, and in particular, should be comfortable working with data structures, designing classes, and writing software modules.
    learning_objectives: |
      Students will experience the design and construction of internet-based systems through hands-on interaction with course material. The course will provide students with a basis of theory upon which to reflect upon experiences: designing and building server-side systems that must serve multiple client system types; designing and building several types of client systems that operate and interact with the server system concurrently and asynchronously; debugging process timing and network failure issues; and building systems on networked physical devices.
    learning_outcomes: |
      Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

        * Understand and explain the theoretical approaches to dealing with concurrency in software
        * Explain the types of problems that can occur in software when processes operate concurrently
        * Understand and explain the theoretical approaches to building software systems with components that operate asynchronously
        * Understand and explain how messages travel between systems on the internet, including the various protocols used and what information they require and provide
        * Understand what services are offered by commercial cloud providers, and how those services fit into internet-based distributed software architectures
        * Build and deploy server-side API software capable of serving multiple client software types
        * Build and deploy web-based client software that communicates with a server-side API
        * Build and deploy a software client on a mobile device that communicates with a server-side API
        * Build, configure and deploy an internet-of-things or web-of-things device that communicates with a server-side API
        * Reflect on the unique requirements of internet-based software
        * Know where to look for more information on the topics covered in this course
