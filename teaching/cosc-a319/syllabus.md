      This course explores the concepts and technologies that are used in modern Internet systems, and provides the necessary skills and knowledge of software technologies needed for creating Internet/Web services. It is designed to expose students to web content presentation and generation technologies, programming, and building multi-tiered client/server web applications.
    description: |
      This course introduces students to the world of internet and networked systems development. Concepts related to distributed systems development; concurrent and asynchronous processing; process communications and network transport protocols; distributed application architecture and design; deployment, monitoring and debugging of internet-based systems; and web of things development will be covered.
    prerequisites: |
      One of:

      * [COSC A212 Introduction to Programming II](https://courses.loyno.edu/course/cosc/a212/introduction-programming-ii) and Sophomore standing
      * Instructor Approval.

      To be successful in this course, students are expected to have practical experience building multi-file/multi-component software projects. In particular, students should be comfortable working with data structures, designing classes and class interfaces, and writing software modules that form part of a larger application.
    learning_objectives: |
      Students will experience the design and construction of internet-based systems through hands-on interaction with course material. The course will provide students with a basis of theory upon which to reflect upon experiences: designing and building server-side systems that must communicate with client systems via internet protocols; designing and building client systems that operate and interact with the server system concurrently and asynchronously; debugging process timing and network failure issues; and understanding the network designs and protocols that enable the modern internet.
    learning_outcomes: |
      Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

        * Understand and explain the theoretical approaches to dealing with concurrency in software and the types of problems that can occur when software processes operate concurrently
        * Understand and explain the theoretical approaches to building software systems with components that operate asynchronously
        * Understand and explain how messages travel between systems on the internet, including the various protocols used and what information they require and provide
        * Build parsers for key internet communication protocols and how they interact to enable modern web applications
        * Understand what types of services are offered by commercial cloud providers, and how those services fit into internet-based distributed software architectures
        * Build and deploy server-side API software capable of serving multiple client software types
        * Build and deploy web-based client software that communicates with a server-side API
        * Reflect on the unique requirements of internet-based software
        * Reflect on the collection of technologies that enable the modern internet
        * Reflect on your own learning process and be able to improve your own learning
        * Know where to look for more information on the topics covered in this course
    topics: |
      This course generally covers some combination of the following topics:

      * The Internet
      * The OSI Layered Network Model
      * Protocols of the Internet (TCP/IP and friends)
      * JavaScript
        * Language & runtime, debugging, and internals
        * In-browser JavaScript, the JS API, and the DOM
        * JavaScript on the server via Node.js
        * JavaScript in desktop apps via Electron
        * JavaScript on mobile devices via React Native
      * Distributed system architectures and the cloud
      * Building, testing and running distributed systems
      * Processes, threads, concurrency and asynchronous operation
      * Network Failure Modes & Mitigation Techniques
      * Replication, scalability and fault tolerance
      * Internet/distributed systems security
      * Embedded devices and the Web of Things
    learning_format: |
      **Content Delivery.** This course is taught in an experiential format. While there are lectures on the conceptual content (network models, application architectures, failure modes, protocols, etc.), these are delivered alongside practice lab and demo sessions and hands-on work on a semester-long individual project that provides direct experience with a number of these concepts. Where it is impossible to present conceptual content through the project, demonstrations during class and assignments are used to help make conceptual content clear.

      **Critical Reflection.** With an experiential format, research has shown that students retain material better when they reflect critically on their learning. As such, students will be expected to write weekly reflection journal entries, as well as a short personal reflection essay at the end of the semester.

      **Assessment.** There are no exams in this course. In fact, assignments and project work do not have numeric grade values either. Instead, at the midterm and the final, you will be expected to write a reflection-based grade proposal and defense. In this short paper, you will indicate what letter grade you feel you have earned in the course and defend that grade to me by reflecting on specific examples of your work, learning, and accomplishments.

    project:
      title: Project
      icon: üèó
      description: |
        During this course, you will build a multi-component internet system using some of the concepts learned through lecture and demo.

        The project entails creating two key components:

        * a **web API server** that can provide data and back-end services for client applications
        * a **browser-based client application** (commonly called a "web app") for interacting with the API server's back-end services via a computer through a website

        Several class periods during the semester are set aside for demonstrations, homework help, or lab exploration. These days are opportunities for you to see how such projects are built, ask questions about issues you are having on your own project, or tell your peers about problems you've experienced while working on your project and how you overcame them. These sessions will be enough time to clarify the required functionality for each assignment with instructor/faculty assistance, get started on project work or assignments, and get help on problems you are experiencing while working on projects or assignments. However, these sessions likely will not be enough to complete the project. Please expect to dedicate time outside of class to working on the project on your own.

        All programming for the project will be done using JavaScript. While JavaScript was originally created for use in the web browser, it is now used often in various non-browser ways. During this course, you'll learn to use modern JavaScript coding style and syntax to develop applications in a variety of those contexts and make them work together.
    reflection:
      title: Reflection Journals
      icon: üìì
      description: |
        ### Weekly Journal Entries
        
        During this course, you will keep a journal with at least weekly reflections on your experiences.
        
        At the midpoint and the end of the semester, you will be required to write a short (5-10 pages) personal reflection essay based on your journaling which examines the following questions:

        * What grade do you believe you've earned in this course so far? Why?
        * What activities did you perform during this course?
        * What were your expectations at the beginning of the course? How did your expectations and attitudes change throughout the semester?
        * Describe moments of clarity that occurred for you during this course? What made the concept clear for you? How did you gain a better understanding of it?
        * Did the project in this course make your understanding of software development and computer science clearer? Your understanding of the Internet and Internet-based applications? How?
        * What did you learn about yourself during this experience?
        * What did you learn about others during this experience?
        * How can you use what you learned through this experience in your future coursework and in your future career? Do you feel better prepared for your career path after this experience? Why?
        * What topics will you continue exploring after the course? Why does each interest you? How will you go about exploring each of those concepts?
    final:
      title: Assessments
      icon: ‚úÖ
      description: |
        There will be two assessments in this course, a MIDTERM PAPER and a FINAL PAPER, each requiring you to propose the letter grade you believe you earned to that point and defend it by reflecting on your understanding of the material covered, your learning process, your efforts, and your accomplishments. At a minimum, each paper should address the questions indicated in the **Reflection Journals** section.
        
        These papers should each be approximately 5&mdash;10 pages and should use appropriate spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
