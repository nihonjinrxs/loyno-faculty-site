      This course explores the concepts and technologies that are used in modern Internet systems, and provides the necessary skills and knowledge of software technologies needed for creating Internet/Web services. It is designed to expose students to web content presentation and generation technologies, programming, and building multi-tiered client/server web applications.
    description: |
      This course introduces students to the world of internet and networked systems development. Concepts related to distributed systems development; concurrent and asynchronous processing; process communications and network transport protocols; distributed application architecture and design; deployment, monitoring and debugging of internet-based systems; and web of things development will be covered.
    prerequisites: |
      One of:

      * [COSC A212 Introduction to Programming II](http://2017bulletin.loyno.edu/undergraduate/computer-science#cosc-a212) and Sophomore standing
      * Instructor Approval.

      To be successful in this course, students are expected to have practical experience building multi-file/multi-component software projects. In particular, students should be comfortable working with data structures, designing classes and class interfaces, and writing software modules that form part of a larger application.
    learning_objectives: |
      Students will experience the design and construction of internet-based systems through hands-on interaction with course material. The course will provide students with a basis of theory upon which to reflect upon experiences: designing and building server-side systems that must serve multiple client system types; designing and building several types of client systems that operate and interact with the server system concurrently and asynchronously; debugging process timing and network failure issues; and building systems on networked physical devices; understanding the network designs and protocols that enable the modern internet.
    learning_outcomes: |
      Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

        * Understand and explain the theoretical approaches to dealing with concurrency in software
        * Explain the types of problems that can occur in software when processes operate concurrently
        * Understand and explain the theoretical approaches to building software systems with components that operate asynchronously
        * Understand and explain how messages travel between systems on the internet, including the various protocols used and what information they require and provide
        * Understand what services are offered by commercial cloud providers, and how those services fit into internet-based distributed software architectures
        * Build and deploy server-side API software capable of serving multiple client software types
        * Build and deploy web-based client software that communicates with a server-side API
        * Build and deploy a software client on a mobile device that communicates with a server-side API
        * Build, configure and deploy an internet-of-things or web-of-things device that communicates with a server-side API
        * Reflect on the unique requirements of internet-based software
        * Reflect on the collection of technologies that enable the modern internet
        * Know where to look for more information on the topics covered in this course
    topics: |
      This course generally covers some combination of the following topics:

      * The Internet
      * Embedded devices and the Web of Things
      * JavaScript
        * Language & runtime, debugging, and internals
        * In-browser JavaScript, the JS API, and the DOM

        * JavaScript on mobile devices via React Native
      * Distributed system architectures and the cloud
      * The OSI Layered Network Model
      * Protocols of the Internet (TCP/IP and friends)
      * Processes, threads, concurrency and asynchronous operation
      * Network Failure Modes & Mitigation Techniques
      * Replication, scalability and fault tolerance
      * Internet/distributed systems security
      * Building, testing and running distributed systems
    learning_format: |
      **Content Delivery.** This course is taught in an experiential format. While there are lectures on the conceptual content (network models, application architectures, failure modes, protocols, etc.), these are delivered alongside hands-on work on a semester-long individual project that provides direct experience with a number of these concepts. Where it is impossible to present conceptual content through the project, demonstrations during class are used to help make conceptual content clear.

      **Critical Reflection.** With an experiential format, research has shown that students retain material better when they reflect critically on their learning. As such, students will be expected to write weekly reflection journal entries, as well as a short personal reflection essay at the end of the semester.

      **Exams.** There are two exams in this course: a midterm and a final, which together usually account for about 40% of the course grade. The semester-long project is also worth a similar proportion of the grade.

    project:
      title: Project
      icon: üèó
      description: |
        During this course, you will build a multi-component internet system using some of the concepts learned through lecture and demo.

        The project entails creating several components:

        * a **web API server** that can provide data and back-end services for client applications
        * a **web-of-things hardware device** for reporting the state of a number of sensors and interacting with the API server's back-end services, using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ system board
        * a **browser-based client application** (commonly called a "web app") for interacting with the API server's back-end services via a computer through a website
        * a **mobile application** (such as you might find in an app store like Apple's or Google Play) for interacting with the server's back-end services via a mobile phone

        Several class periods during the semester are set aside for working on the project during class. These days will help you to get started building out the required functionality for each assignment with instructor/faculty assistance, but likely will not be enough to complete the project assignments. Please expect to dedicate time outside of class to working on the project on your own.

        All programming for the project will be done using JavaScript. While JavaScript was originally created for use in the web browser, it is now used often in various non-browser ways. During this course, you'll learn to use modern JavaScript coding style and syntax to develop applications in a variety of those contexts and make them work together.

        There are also usually a few extra credit opportunities associated with the project that you may wish to take advantage of.
    reflection:
      title: Reflection Journals
      icon: üìì
      description: |
        ### Weekly Journal Entries
        
        During this course, you will keep a journal with at least weekly reflections on your experiences.
        
        At the end of the semester, you will be required to write a short (5-10 pages) personal reflection essay based on your journaling which examines the following questions:

        * What activities did you perform during this course?
        * What were your expectations at the beginning of the course? How did your expectations and attitudes change throughout the semester?
        * Describe a moment of clarity that occurred for you during this course? What made the concept clear for you? How did you gain a better understanding of it?
        * Did the project in this course make your understanding of software development and computer science clearer? Your understanding of the Internet and Internet-based applications? How?
        * What did you learn about yourself during this experience?
        * What did you learn about others during this experience?
        * How can you use what you learned through this experience in your future coursework and in your future career? Do you feel better prepared for your career path after this experience? Why?
        * What topics will you continue exploring after the course? Why does each interest you? How will you go about exploring each of those concepts?
    final:
      title: Exams
      icon: ‚úÖ
      description: |
        There will be two exams in this course, a MIDTERM EXAM and a FINAL EXAM, each testing your understanding of the material covered in the prior half of the semester.
        
        The FINAL EXAM will last only one hour instead of two, and the remainder of the final exam period will be used for final project demos.
