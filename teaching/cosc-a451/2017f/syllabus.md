    title: Course Project
    description: |
      In this course, you will build and deploy real software using the processes, practices, and ideas you&#39;re learning about. The course project is a large effort that will be completed as a team.
      
      ### About the project
      The project will be a web application, and will be built with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) using the [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) web framework. Project, requirement, code and code review artifacts will be managed via [GitHub](https://github.com) using the [git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system.
      
      ### Expectations of students
      As with any major software development effort, you will be expected to work independently and as a team outside the classroom in order to complete this project. You will be expected to coordinate with classmates on your own in order to facilitate team collaborative work outside of class.
      
      ### Project Schedule
      We will discuss the project beginning in Week 3, plan our first development iteration (or sprint) at the end of that week, and begin development immediately afterward. In total, the project will cover four (4) three-week sprints, scheduled as follows:
      
      * Sprint 1: 9/7 - 9/26
      * Sprint 2: 9/26 - 10/17
      * Sprint 3: 10/17 - 11/7
      * Sprint 4: 11/7 - 11/30
      
      Each sprint will begin during the class period with a **planning session**. During this session, you will, as a team, estimate the development effort required for requirements and decide on a subset of requirements you will implement during the iteration. As a team, you will commit to completing these requirements entirely by the end of the iteration.
      
      During the course of the sprint, we will begin each class period with a quick **stand-up meeting**. The purpose of this meeting is to identify (1) what&#39;s been done since the last stand-up; (2) what you&#39;re planning to do before the next stand-up; (3) what impediments are blocking progress on your work; and (4) what help you need from your teammates. No problem-solving will happen during this meeting -- any identified impediments or needed help will be handled in a scheduled session with your teammates outside of class.
      
      At the close of each sprint, you, as a team, will **demonstrate the software increment** you built during the iteration. This demonstration should focus on the value the software increment provides to the customer/client and users of the software. You should be prepared to answer questions about what you&#39;ve built and how it works.
      
      Following the demonstration, we will engage in a **retrospective session**, where we will evaluate how well the development practices and process used worked, and identify ways to improve these for the next iteration. At the close of the retrospective, we will add one or more process improvement tasks to our list of requirements that _must_ be tackled within the next iteration.

    title: Final Issue Paper and Presentation
    description: |
      Professional software engineers encounter ethics issues frequently in the work they do. Many professional software engineers adopt a code of ethics that guides their approach to their work and helps them decide what kinds of work they are willing to do.
      
      To experience some of this, as a final exam for this course, you will write an **in-depth issue paper on a software ethics question or problem of your choice**, and present your findings to the class.

      You will have the entire semester to work on this paper and presentation. Thus, you will be expected to research the topic in detail, finding and presenting a detailed analysis of the various approaches, perspectives, and implications associated with the issue you have chosen. While there is no page limit, your paper will be judged on the completeness of the ideas presented (see _How you will be graded_ below), and an extraordinarily concise treatment of an ethics issue will likely require well over 10 pages single-spaced.
      
      During the final exam period (Thursday 12/14 from 4:30 - 6:30 PM), you will give a **15 to 20 minute presentation** to the class on your findings. This presentation should describe and illustrate for your classmates the answers you found for all the analysis questions (see _How you will be graded_ below).
      
      ### Paper topics
      We will discuss the final paper assignment in the first class period. From that time, you will have two weeks in which to select and turn in a brief (3-5 sentences) paragraph on the topic you have chosen to research. All topics will be approved by the instructor during week three (3).
      
      ### Available resources
      In order to assist you in your topic selection and research, several resources are available to you.
      
      * Ethics books on reserve in the University Library
      * Other ethics books of interest
      * Codes of ethics
      * Ethics papers
      * Online resources

      ### How you will be graded
      Your paper and presentation must present a complete and detailed analysis of the issue you&#39;ve chosen. In particular, your paper must address in detail the following **analysis questions**:
      
      * What is the issue?
      * Why is it an ethical issue?
      * Why should it concern us?
      * Are there related laws or legal frameworks related to this issue?
      * What are the prominent perspectives on this issue?
      * What are the implications of those perspectives?
      * What are some proposed solutions to the issue?
      * What are the implications of those proposals?
        
      Your presentation must also address each of these questions in sufficient detail to give classmates a clear understanding of what you found while maintaining the interest of your audience and fitting within the allotted time period.
      
      In addition to content, you will be graded on the correctness of your writing (spelling, grammar, punctuation, word choice, etc.), the readability and formatting of your submitted paper (font choice, margins, line length, spacing, etc.), and on your presentation skills (vocal projection, clarity of speech, appropriateness of movement, eye contact, visual aids, appropriate attire, etc.). Please be careful in your writing and practice your presentation prior to the final exam period.
