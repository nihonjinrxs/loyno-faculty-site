<h3 id="-the-tools">üõ† The Tools</h3>

<p>To do this, we‚Äôll use JavaScript with HTML and CSS, as you might expect, but we‚Äôll also use two key JavaScript libraries and four infrastructure tools/services:</p>

<h4 id="-javascript-libraries">üì¶ JavaScript Libraries</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> - a library for building dynamic web interfaces using JavaScript in a componentized and manageable way. Along with React, <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">create-react-app</a> is a companion library that scaffolds a web-based application for you using React for components. (This scaffolding piece will be done for you for this first project day.)</li>
  <li><a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> - a testing library included with the project scaffold created by create-react-app that allows testing your code. Along with Jest, <a href="https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro">react-testing-library</a> is a companion library that provides easy ways to render components and assert properties on them when testing.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="-infrastructure-services">üè≠ Infrastructure Services</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com">Github</a> - a web service providing hosting and additional features for the <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> distributed version control system. You‚Äôll be using git and Github to manage your codebase.</li>
  <li><a href="https://education.travis-ci.com">Travis CI</a> - a continuous integration platform that you‚Äôll use to ensure every commit you push to Github passes all automated tests.</li>
  <li><a href="https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&amp;offering=community">Docker (Community Edition)</a> - a software containerization platform that allows building an image of your software and deploying that built image.</li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> - a suite of cloud services where we will deploy our work. (You should already have applied for, and hopefully received, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/">AWS Educate</a> membership, which provides some free credits in addition to the free services you get during the first year of AWS membership.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-requirements-for-the-assignment">‚úÖ Requirements for the Assignment</h3>

<p>Create a web-based application that provides an interface to the data collected by your IoT/WoT Device Weather Station, displaying temperature and humidity data using the user‚Äôs choice of scale for temperature display.</p>

<p>Assume that data reported by the Weather Station is in Celsius degrees for temperature and in percentage for humidity.</p>

<h4 id="Ô∏è-functional-requirements">‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Build an application that is viewable through a web browser.</li>
  <li>The application should have a single page that shows a title and well-formatted temperature and humidity values.</li>
  <li>The page should be decorated with an image background.</li>
  <li>The application should simulate real data for display by generating random numbers in a realistic range (about 7¬∞C ‚Äì 33¬∞C for temperature and about 5% ‚Äì 98% for humidity).</li>
  <li>The application should display real-time updates of the data on the page without refreshing the page in the browser.</li>
  <li>The application should allow the user to select the temperature display units, and should display the data in the requested units without refreshing the page in the browser.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="-source-code-process--deployment-requirements">üî© Source Code, Process &amp; Deployment Requirements</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Code for the application should be well-organized, using components and folders to keep related code together.</li>
  <li>The application should make use of Github for version control. Commits should be small, be well-described in their commit messages, and contain a single change to the application.</li>
  <li>All code for the application should be well-tested. (This means that for each function you write, you should write at least one, and possibly several, tests.) Automated tests should run on every commit and pull request to the repo.</li>
  <li>The application should be deployed to Amazon Web Services as a Docker Container, and should be live (that is, publicly available on the Internet).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="-the-tools-1">üõ† The Tools</h3>

<p>To do this, we‚Äôll use JavaScript in its Node.js form, but we‚Äôll also use a few key JavaScript libraries and four infrastructure tools/services:</p>

<h4 id="-javascript-libraries-1">üì¶ JavaScript Libraries</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> - a library for building web servers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> - a testing library (chosen because this is hat was used for Project Day 1, included with the project scaffold created by create-react-app) that allows testing your code.

</ul>

<h3 id="-requirements-for-the-assignment-1">‚úÖ Requirements for the Assignment</h3>

<p>In this portion of the project, you‚Äôll build an API with endpoints that allow getting weather sensor data, updating weather sensor data, and eventually registering sensors with the API to handle multiple sensors.</p>

<h4 id="Ô∏è-functional-requirements-1">‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new Express-based API with a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> endpoint at the path <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/beacon</code> that responds with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">200</code> status code, and the plain text <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OK</code>. Appropriate response headers should be set when the API returns a response.</li>
  <li>Create a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> endpoint at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/weather-sensor/data</code> to get data from the sensor. The endpoint should respond with JSON-format data with keys <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"temperature"</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"humidity"</code>. Appropriate response headers should be set when the API returns a response. Values for temperature and humidity can be generated randomly upon request for now.</li>
  <li>Create a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST</code> endpoint at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/weather-sensor/update</code> to allow a sensor to send new data to the API. Successful operation should result in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">201</code> status code. Appropriate response headers should be set when the API returns a response.</li>
  <li>Update the API to maintain a list of registered sensors in memory, and modify the previously created <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST</code> requests to accept a path-based parameter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:id</code> for the sensor identifier, moving their mount points to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/weather-sensors/:id/{data|update}</code>.</li>
  <li>Create a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> endpoint at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/weather-sensors</code> that returns a list of sensors registered with the API. Appropriate response status code and headers should be set when the API returns a response.</li>
  <li>Create a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST</code> endpoint at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/weather-sensors/register</code> that allows a weather sensor device to register itself with the API. Appropriate response status code and headers should be set when the API returns a response.</li>

<h3 id="-the-tools-2">üõ† The Tools</h3>

<p>For this project day, you begin working with hardware. During this assignment, you‚Äôll be creating a device with several hardware components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Raspberry Pi 3B+ - the controller device used to coordinate the interaction of all the sensors and actuators, and to run the software you write</li>
  <li>a DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor - used to retrieve atmospheric data to feed into the Server API</li>
  <li>a multi-color LED - used for immediate display of temperature range by color</li>
  <li>a passive infrared (PIR) sensor - used to detect when there is someone near the device</li>
  <li>a single-color LED - used to indicate when the PIR sensor detects someone</li>
  <li>an LED touch screen - (in a future assignment) used to display the on-board app that shows sensor values</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="../COSC-A319-Class-Project_bb.png"><img src="../COSC-A319-Class-Project_bb.png" alt="Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Breadboard layout" /></a></p>

<p>Recall, the GPIO pin layout on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ is as follows.</p>

  <li><strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/onoff">onoff</a></strong> - a library for interacting with devices on the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-dht-sensor">node-dht-sensor</a></strong> - a library for interacting with the DHT22 sensor specifically, as it has a proprietary binary protocol for its data</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>LED Library</strong> For the single-color LED (an actuator), create an importable library file that exports the following interface functions to control the LED: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">turnOn()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">turnOff()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lightSwitch(booleanValue)</code>. The library should also export an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init(gpioPin)</code> function to identify the GPIO pin on which the LED resides.</li>
  <li><strong>MulticolorLED Library</strong> For the multi-color LED (also an actuator), create an importable library file that exports the following interface functions to control the LED: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">turnOn()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">turnOff()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setColor(colorArg)</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">colorArg</code> is either a hexadecimal color value string (i.e., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'#54A5B3'</code>) or an object with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">red</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">green</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blue</code> property values. The library should also export an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init(gpioPins)</code> function to identify the GPIO pins that control the color values for the LED (where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpioPins</code> is an object with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">red</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">green</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blue</code> property values).</li>
  <li><strong>PIR Library</strong> For the PIR sensor, create an importable library file that exports the following interface functions to read from the PIR sensor: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">watch()</code> - generates events that can be acted upon on a change of value, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seesSomething()</code> - returns a boolean. The library should also export an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init(gpioPin)</code> function to identify the GPIO pin on which to listen for data.</li>
  <li><strong>DHT Library</strong> For the DHT22 sensor, create an importable library file that exports the following interface functions to read from the DHT sensor: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">watch()</code> - generates events that can be acted upon on a change of value, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read()</code> - reads the current data from the sensor, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">intervalRead(intervalMilliseconds, callbackFunction)</code> - reads data from the sensor on an interval and calls the callback function with the data. The library should also export an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init(gpioPin)</code> function to identify the GPIO pin on which to listen for data.</li>
  <li><strong>PIR controls LED</strong> Write a program that imports the PIR sensor and single-color LED actuator libraries, and make the LED turn on when the PIR sensor sees something, and turn off when it does not. Be sure to use asynchronous methods, so that none of the listening activity blocks other processes running simultaneously in your program. Also, be sure to handle turning everything off when the program stops (see ‚ÄúError handling‚Äù below).</li>
  <li><strong>DHT controls MulticolorLED</strong> Write a program that imports the DHT sensor and multi-color LED actuator libraries, and make the LED actuator display a range from blue (approximately 7¬∞C) to red (approximately 33¬∞C) based on the temperature value read from the sensor. Be sure to use asynchronous methods, so that none of the listening activity blocks other processes running simultaneously in your program. Also, be sure to handle turning everything off when the program stops (see ‚ÄúError handling‚Äù below).</li>
  <li><strong>Main program</strong> Write a wrapper program that imports the programs you wrote for requirements 5 and 6, and starts them both.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Hardware build</strong> Your device should be built so that it works as described in the functional requirements above. Provided system diagrams are a recommendation, but if you find that a different wiring better suits your needs, you should feel free to implement it.</li>
  <li><strong>Code organization and style</strong> Code for the application should be well-organized, using components and folders to keep related code together. Code should be written asynchronously where possible in order to allow for multiple simultaneous activities.</li>
  <li><strong>Tests</strong> All code for the application should be well-tested. (This means that for each function you write, you should write at least one, and possibly several, tests.) Automated tests should run on every commit and pull request to the repo.</li>
  <li><strong>Error handling</strong> Code should also handle errors and software termination (premature or otherwise) gracefully. For software termination, you may want to look at handling the following events on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">process</code> object: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGINT</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGUSR1</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGUSR2</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uncaughtException</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unhandledRejection</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Version control</strong> The application should make use of Github for version control. Commits should be small, be well-described in their commit messages, and contain a single change to the application.</li>

<p>During this assignment, you‚Äôll continue working the tools mentioned for PROJECT DAY 1 and PROJECT DAY 3, and combine them by using the following JavaScript libraries:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a></strong> - a library for creating desktop applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.electron.build/">Electron Builder</a></strong> - a companion library for Electron that builds your application as a desktop app.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-is-dev">ElectronIsDev</a></strong> - a companion library for Electron that identifies whether an Electron app is running in development mode or as a built application artifact.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently">Concurrently</a></strong> - a library that lets you run start multiple processes concurrently from the command line.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/wait-on">wait-on</a></strong> - a library that provides a command-line way to wait for a specified dependency to be available before running the next command.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, you‚Äôll be attaching the <strong><a href="http://www.lcdwiki.com/3.5inch_RPi_Display">LCD TFT TouchScreen Display</a></strong> to your Raspberry Pi, and using the <strong><a href="https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show">LCD-show</a></strong> software to control the display output on your device. Your display is the Raspberry Pi 3.5in Display.</p>

<p>You can switch video output to the attached LCD display by running the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LCD35-show</code> program from the command line. To switch back to the HDMI port, you can run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HDMI-show</code> program. These programs, and the display drivers, are already installed on your Raspberry Pi 3B+.</p>

<h3 id="-requirements-for-the-assignment-3">‚úÖ Requirements for the Assignment</h3>

<h4 id="Ô∏è-functional-requirements-3">‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Make a copy of your Web Client application in a new folder, then follow <a href="../converting-cra-to-electron">the instructions for converting your Create React App application to an Electron application</a>. Once done, you should have an application that is runnable as a desktop application in development, and that can be built into a desktop executable for your computer and for the Raspberry Pi 3B+. (Be sure to test building on both systems.)</li>
  <li>Add the sensor library code you wrote for the last assignment to your web app in a new folder, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;web client root&gt;/lib/sensors</code>.</li>
  <li>Modify and import the sensor libraries as needed in your application in order to enable the data displayed on the application interface to be the actual data coming off the sensors. Be sure to use the integrations you did for the last assignment to ensure that the hardware indicators of sensor value (i.e., the LEDs) are also enabled.</li>
  <li>Convert the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code> element that wraps the content rendered by your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">App</code> component into a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WeatherStationDisplay</code> component. This should include moving all relevant state and props values to the new component.</li>
  <li>Add a new component to your React app that displays a completely black screen with no content. Modify your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">App</code> component to display that new blank screen component as default, and to display the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WeatherStationDisplay</code> component when the PIR sensor sees something. After switching to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WeatherStationDisplay</code> component, the app should wait 30 seconds after the PIR sensor no longer sees anything before switching back to the blank screen component.</li>
  <li>Build the application on the Raspberry Pi 3B+, and enable running it on boot in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/rc.local</code> file. <strong>Note: do NOT do this until you know it‚Äôs running without failing.</strong> To do so, you can edit the file using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo nano /etc/rc.local</code>, and add the full absolute path to the built executable as a new line in the file, and end that new line with an ampersand (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code>) to run the program as a background job. If not there already, be sure to add a line at the end of the file that says <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit 0</code>.</li>

<p>You will use the same tools for this as you‚Äôve used for prior assignments.</p>

<p>The one new concept you‚Äôll need is the concept of <a href="https://sookocheff.com/post/networking/how-do-websockets-work/">web sockets</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC 6455</a>).</p>

<p>The following articles on the Mozilla Developer Network provide more information about how Web Sockets applications can be built both on the server and client side:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers">Writing WebSocket servers</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications">Writing WebSocket client applications</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">The WebSockets API</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To work with web sockets, you‚Äôll use the <strong><a href="https://github.com/websockets/ws">ws</a></strong> library for node.js, which provides an abstraction interface which takes care of a lot of the details of server-side web sockets implementation.</p>

<h4 id="Ô∏è-functional-requirements-server-api">‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements: Server API</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/weather-sensors/register</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST</code> endpoint is available, and that it maintains a list of registered sensors.</li>
  <li>Create a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> endpoint <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/weather-sensors/updates-channels/:id</code> on the API that supports upgrading the connection to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WebSocket</code> connection. Ensure that the endpoint creates a single new socket for any known weather sensor ID, and replaces an old socket (after draining it of data events) if a new request from the same sensor comes in, and rejects requests from unknown sensors with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">401 Unauthorized</code> response.</li>
  <li>Implement handlers on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WebSocket</code> connections to handle all appropriate events in the lifecycle of the connection, including but not limited to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connection</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upgrade</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">message</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">close</code>.</li>

<h4 id="Ô∏è-functional-requirements-wotiot-device">‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements: WoT/IoT Device</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Modify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.js</code> (or whichever file in your WoT application from Assignment 4 starts the device integrations) to import your DHT Library and begin watching the DHT sensor.</li>
  <li>In the same file, make a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST</code> request to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/weather-sensors/register</code> endpoint, specifying a sensor ID and appropriate configuration information (you will likely need to tell the API what measurements to expect and what units they will be specified with).</li>
  <li>Also in the same file, make an initial data update using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST</code> request to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/weather-sensors/:id/update</code> endpoint.</li>
  <li>Finally, create a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WebSocket</code> connection to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/weather-sensors/updates-channels/:id</code> endpoint, using the sensor ID specified above as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:id</code> value in the URI.</li>
  <li>Complete your web socket implementation by writing an event handler on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> event on the DHT sensor object that sends the new information to the API via the web socket connection created.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="-source-code-process--deployment-requirements-4">üî© Source Code, Process &amp; Deployment Requirements</h4>

On program termination, as with closing out hardware connections cleanly (see ASSIGNMENT 3), be sure to close out any web socket connections you may have created before exiting the program.</li>
  <li><strong>Version control</strong> The application should make use of Github for version control. Commits should be small, be well-described in their commit messages, and contain a single change to the application.</li>
  <li><strong>Deployment</strong> The Server API should be demonstrable locally on your computer. Extra points will be given for deployments in Amazon Web Services using ECS (see ASSIGNMENT 2). Code that runs on the WoT device must be deployed to the device and must start on device boot. You should be able to demonstrate the integration in class on the due date of the assignment.</li>
