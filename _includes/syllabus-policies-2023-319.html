  üìú INSTRUCTOR'S POLICIES
  <span class="right toplink"><a href="#title" alt="go to top">üîù</a></span>
</h2>
<h3><a name='header-n1225' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Participation/Behavior expected in class</h3>
<p>Please maintain an atmosphere of respect toward others.</p>
<h3><a name='header-n1148' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Attendance</h3>
<p>By this point in your degree program, you should be able to manage your time appropriately and professionally. I expect you to be in class and to participate during every class period. Attendance is required and promptness is appreciated.</p>
<p>If there is a reason you must be absent, please arrange with the instructor in advance so that you can receive instruction for how to keep up with the material. Any absence not arranged with the instructor and approved in advance will result in a loss of the daily classtime participation grade if applicable, or count against you in consideration of your grade proposal otherwise. (See grading policy above.)</p>
<p>Absences from class will be excused <strong>only</strong> in accordance with the <a href="https://bulletin.loyno.edu/regulations/grades-grade-point-averages#attendance" target="_blank">University Attendance Policy's required circumstances</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Please come to class on time and remain until class is dismissed.</strong></p>
<h3><a name='header-n1155' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Cell Phones</h3>
<p>Cell phones must be turned off during class, unless being used to test project work or participate in class meetings.</p>
<h3><a name='header-n1158' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Email</h3>
<p>Students must check their Loyola email <strong>at least daily</strong>.</p>
{% if page.syllabus.class_chat.include %}
<h3><a name='header-n1161' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Class Chat</h3>
{% if page.syllabus.class_chat.policy != null %}
{{ page.syllabus.class_chat.policy }}
{% else %}
<p>During this course, much of your project work will be orchestrated outside of class periods using the class chat service. You will be expected to actively participate in that chat throughout the course of the project.</p>
{% endif %}
{% endif %}
<h3><a name='header-n1164' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Late Work</h3>
<p>As a professional, if you miss a deadline, there are consequences.</p>
<p>In this class, your instructor is available and happy to help you with any road blocks you encounter in the assigned work. Please start on the assignments early, and ask for help if you need it. Although we are using non-standard grading, instances of unfinished work or of work not turned in before the deadline reflect poorly on your ability to perform the skills you're learning, and will result in a lower grade at the midterm and/or final.</p>
<h4><a name='header-n1167' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Project</h4>
<p>For the project, you should treat assignment deadlines as professional project deadlines. Please do your best to complete all requirements before the deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Notify the instructor as soon as you are aware of a delay in completion of project work.</strong> In many cases, your instructor may be able to assist you in getting past the difficult point in the completion of the assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Even if you are not finished, please turn in what you have completed before the deadline.</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to turn in another version following the deadline, you may do so at any time.</strong></p>
<h4><a name='header-n1172' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Other Deadlines</h4>
<p><strong>For all other classroom activities, late work will not be accepted</strong>,
  subject to the exceptions below. This is because, for assignments, we will be moving on to other topics
  and must keep pace to finish the material during the semester. For journals, the timing of the reflection
  is important to you getting a clear picture of your learning process.</p>
<h4><a name='header-n1175' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Excused Absence Policy and Documentation Requirement</h4>
<p>The only exceptions to this classroom policy are for absences which fall under the <a href="https://bulletin.loyno.edu/regulations/grades-grade-point-averages#attendance" target="_blank">University Attendance Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Under that policy, excused absences require <strong>written documentation prior to the absence</strong>. Some excused absences related to health or mental health conditions may require documentation through the Office of Student Affairs or the Office of Disability Services.</p>
<p>In most cases, appropriate documentation consists of an email to the instructor prior to the start of class, but preferably more than 4 hours prior. Please email the instructor as soon as you know you will need to be absent.</p>
<p>Failure to appropriately document such absences will reflect poorly on your learning process, and may affect your grade.</p>
<h3><a name='header-n1182' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Academic Integrity, Cheating and Plagiarism</h3>
<p>In a professional setting, there are significant consequences for dishonesty and lack of integrity, including legal consequences, market reaction, and employer discipline or termination of employment.</p>
<p>As your instructor for this course, I have gone out of my way to ensure that you have a great opportunity to learn the course material in both theoretical and concrete ways. Your part in this learning effort is to do your own original work and give appropriate
  credit for legitimate help you have received.</p>
<p>In keeping with this, students are expected to maintain the highest standards of academic and professional integrity. Behavior that violates these standards is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Some examples of unacceptable behavior in this course are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>unauthorized or unattributed use of material you did not create or do not have the right to claim as your own (per U.S. Copyright Law), including code or written material generated by ChatGPT or similar AI assistants or found online</li>
  <li>communication with fellow students during any assignment, quiz or test that is not explicitly identified by the instructor as group work</li>
  <li>attempting to benefit from the work of another student, including submitting the work of another student as your own</li>
  <li>reusing work from a previous semester, even work you completed on your own if you have not made significant changes relevant to the assignment in question</li>
  <li>similar behavior that defeats the learning intent of any work assigned for this class, including assessments</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheating on quizzes or examinations, plagiarism, improper acknowledgment of sources in essays, and the use of a single essay or paper in more than one course without permission are considered very serious offenses and shall be grounds for disciplinary action as outlined in the current bulletin. Agreement between the student and the faculty member that a violation has occurred, or no response from the student, will result in the assignment of a lower grade or an F to the test or assignment, or in the case of a serious violation, a lower grade or F for the course.</p>
<p><strong>Dishonesty breaks trust, and will be taken very seriously.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In this course, if I suspect you are in violation of the University policy on Academic Honesty and Plagiarism in any way, whether on required assignments, exams, project work, extra credit assignments, or anything else related to this course, I will impose the highest penalty allowed.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you remain in the course, you will need to work extra hard to demonstrate that you are in deed doing the work of learning and have earned your proposed grade.</li>
  <li>Because you have broken trust, I will be forced to reevaluate all other assignments to determine if I may have missed a possible violation. Appropriate action will be taken on every instance in which I suspect you of violating the University‚Äôs policy on Academic Honesty and Plagiarism.</li>
</ul>
<p>For your benefit, the University policy on Academic Honesty and Plagiarism is available in the University Bulletin at <a href='https://bulletin.loyno.edu/regulations/academic-honesty-and-plagiarism' target='_blank'>https://bulletin.loyno.edu/regulations/academic-honesty-and-plagiarism</a>, including procedures associated with processing violations of the policy. Please read it and be familiar with it, as you will be responsible for ensuring your own compliance with it.</p>
